Code style rules:
- Use explicit error handling, no unwraps in production code
- Include docstrings for public functions
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions under 50 lines
- Use `pretty_assertions` in test
- Be explicit about lifetimes in Rust
- Use `anyhow::Result` for error handling in services and repositories.
- Create domain errors using `thiserror`.

- Never implement `From` for converting domain errors, manually convert them
