# To-Do List Manager

This project is a simple command-line To-Do List Manager written in Python. It allows users to:

- View all tasks
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Remove tasks

Tasks are stored in a local JSON file (`todo_list.json`). The application provides a menu-driven interface for easy task management.
